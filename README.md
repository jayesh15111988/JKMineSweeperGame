JKMineSweeperGame
=================

The implementation of classic Minesweeper using Objective-C and Cocoa

As we all played This game in the childhood, this is my honest attempt to actually create the game using 
programming knowledge and logic. It took me couple days to write this game from scratch. But anyways here are some cool 
screenshots of this game.




Game follows regular Minesweeper conventions and it has following existing and additional features. I coding challenge
mentioned on Thumbstack careers page (http://www.thumbtack.com/challenges/software-engineer) motivated me to write 
this game.

It has following features.

1. Support for dynamic board generation
2. Scroll support in case board size is greater than standard iPad screen size
3. Chaet mode to reveal all mines
4. Standard scoring based on the tile revealed and stage as well
5. Choice to select difficulty level (Easy , medium and hard)
6. Verify function - While game is in progress, user can click verify button any time to check if there is a win or it's
still in continuation


I used Objective-C and standard Cocoa libraries for this project.
Future additions:

1. Support for multiple devices and orientations
2. Support to load and save game
3. Support to store and display highest score for multiple users for given device

As usual, any critique or feature requests are welcome. If there are any bugs, let me know. I will try my best to
fix them as soon as possible.
